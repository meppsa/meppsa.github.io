This site will serve as an introspective look into my processes and methods as I venture to learn and progress through the realm of Information Technology. This is my promise to you, the reader, I will always do my best to present well documented and sourced information on whatever topics I choose to explore and discuss. I promise to always give accurate and appropriate credit to those that I learn from whether that be in person or on the web. My door is also always open for discussion and comment, feel free to reach out to me at `s.meppen2@proton.me`. My socials can also be found here at [GitHub][jekyll-gh] and [LinkedIN][jekyll-li]
